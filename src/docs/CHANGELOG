CHANGELOG - ZIKULA 1.2.0
------------------------
Added support for gettext enabled module. Modules and themes can now support the old define based language system or the new gettext method, but not both. If a module or theme has /locale, the core will not search for defines for that component.
Example of gettext enabled module should be legal or Ephemerids and not the core modules and themes which are handled slightly differently.
Core languages installed in /locale/$lang and must contain locale.ini file. Legacy language packs will not load without the corrisponding new language pack in /locale.
New language codes: Zikula now uses short language code and additionally supports language variation, e.g en, en_GB and en_US.
Gettext and i18n support is independent of the OS of the webserver, and independent of system locales.
Added right to left support in themes with <!--[langdirection]-->
General facelift to the user interface.

Added translation functions:
  ZLanguage::getModuleDomain() returns translation domain for a given module.
  ZLanguage::getThemeDomain() returns translation domain for a given theme.
  __() translate string.
  _n() translate with pural.
  __f() translate with sprintf().
  _fn() translate plural with sprintf().

<!--[pndate_format]--> no longer takes defines (but is backwards comapatible). Please use the following strings instead: datelong, datebrief, datestring, datestring2, datetimebrief, datetimelong, timebrief, timelong.

New Plugins:
  <!--[homepage]--> will return the actual homepage of the site (supported by pnGetHomePageURL()).
  <!--[langdirection]--> will return 'ltr' or 'rtl' for use in HTML templates to indicate language direction.
  formatcurrency modifier will format a number according to the current monetary locale.
  formatnumber modifier will format a number according to the current locale.
  <!--[array_field_pop]-->
  dataformat modifier
  <!--[pngetbaseuri]-->
  <!--[gt]--> will translate a given string.
  gt modifier - this is for internal use, (do not use it).
  <!--[langdirection]--> returns ZLanguage::getDirection() (ltr or rtl for language direction).
  <!--[charset]--> returns ZLanguage::getEncoding().
  <!--[case]-->
  <!--[checkgroup]-->
  <!--[switch]-->

locale/$lang/locale.ini used to store locale information for a language code.
CSS classes renamed to z- (old pn- classes will continue to work).
CSS/JS on-the-fly optimization supports:
  Concatenation of all CSS into one file.
  Concatenation of all JS into one file.

Minify JS and CSS.
Forced gz compression for JS and CSS.
Header cache control.
Improved module workflow. The new workflows are:
   Uninitialised->Active->Inactive->Remove
   Inactive->Active
   Upgrade->Active->Inactive->Remove

Improved installer and upgrader layout.
New easy upgrade.php script: this performs all actions required for an upgrade. No need to tediously perform unnecessary manual tasks.
upgrade.php will automatically convert MySQL installations to UTF8 format.

Multi-lingual settings:
   Enable/Disable multi-lingual facility.
   Fix lang parameter to the URL where necessary or always by force.
   Enable/Disable language variations.
   Set default language for site.
   Improved and accurate browser detection (enable/disable)

Module $modversion['displayname'] no longer used to build URL, this has been replaced with $modversion['url'].
pnversion.php format extended with $modversion['url'] = __('foo', $dom); this should generally be a lower case get, but not similar to displayname.
Modules Manager: option added to restore customised module fields to their defaults globally from Module->Settings or individually from each module's edit screen.
Short URLs now support the lang param.
'thelang' block no longer set's user's language preference, this has been moved to the User module.

Deprecated the following defines:
  _CHARSET
  _LOCALE
  _LOCALEWIN
  _DATEBRIEF
  _DATELONG
  _DATESTRING
  _DATESTRING2
  _DATETIMEBRIEF
  _DATETIMELONG

SessionUtil::getVar('lang') totally deprecated, returns ZLanguage::getLanguageCodeLegacy()

Added ZI18n class to handle numbers and currency.
DataUtil methods to convert user input to internal format according to the input locale: transformNumberInternal(), transformCurrencyInternal().
DataUtil methods to format numbers for display according to the locale: formatNumber() and formatCurrency().
Improved DataUtil::is_serialized().
Added DataUtil::parseIniFile() to cope with variations according to OS.
DateUtil class fixed to correctly calculate the difference between the server and user's timezone when formatting a string. Also format the month/day names with the translation strings instead rely on the server's installed locales.
Introduced DataUtil::mb_unserialize() to handle multibyte data that was once stored in the database in ISO format and later converted to UTF8. Such serialised data will be broken. This method will correctly unserialise it. This should be used once only to fix serialised data - emphasis that this issue only affects serialised data with multibyte content. Several routines have been stored in Users/pninit.php, Modules/pninit.php, Blocks/pninit.php showing this conversion for known tables with issues these issues.
Upgrade script migrates Blocks and Category data to use new language codes, example code in respective module's pninit.php files.
Fixed SeaBreeze theme.
Added auto update notification when a new version of the Core is released.

pnConfigGetVar('language') is deprecated, should use pnConfigGetVar('language_i18n') instead. This specifies the system default language which is used as part of the algorythm to determine which language to serve - this does NOT tell you the language in use, ZLanguage::getLanguageCode() returns this.
Dynamic keywords facility removed.
Removed WHERE_IS_PERSO.
Integrated automatic use of addition of advMailer if installed.
Prepared core to use new MultiSites module if installed.
Added LogUtil::registerArgsError().
Completed integration of LogUtil::registerPermissionsError().
'extmenu' block supresses Error, Header_Footer and Blocks modules in 'display installed modules' option.
Fixed flawed pninit upgrade logic. Modules should return the current version number as a string on fail. Case statements have no break to allow automatic flow of one upgrade routine to the next. See all system modules as examples.
Added Texpand.js to expand text boxes.
Added Zikula.itemlist.js
HTML settings moved from Settings module to SecurityCenter.
Outsourced AuthLDAP, blank, FAQ, Feeds, MultiSites (legacy), Pages, PendingContent, Ratings, Recommend_Us, Reviews, Sniffer, Thumbnail, and Topics to Parked projects.
