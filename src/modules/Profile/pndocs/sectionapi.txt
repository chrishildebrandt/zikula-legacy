  SECTION API

    The Profile section API is like an interface to the external modules APIs
    to list the latest activities of a specific user, or other stuff.

    The API consist in a plugin, a function and a template.
    The entrypoint is the plugin, should call it from the Profile view template:
    <!--[profilesection name='EZComments']-->

    By default, the plugin will add the UID of the user's current profile
    to the parameters, if it's not defined plus others, like:
    <!--[profilesection name='EZComments' uid=$uid numitems=5]-->

    The plugin will call to a section API function: Profile_sectionapi_ezcomments,
    that can be stored in /config/functions/Profile/pnsectionapi/ezcomments.php
    but this time, it's a default function included in /modules/Profile/pnsectionapi.php
    That function is the responsible to retrieve the data to show in the section template.

    This data, will be assigned to the $section variable in the
    profile_section_ezcomments.htm template. There the data is listed and customized
    accordingly. That template can be stored in the /config/templates/Profile/sections folder.

    The output generated by that template, will be shown where the profilesection
    plugin was called. Then, you can call different sections in the position of the 
    view template that you want, and mantain and extend the profiles of your users with ease.

    Any translation used in the function or API, should be included in the custom POT catalog
    in /config/locale/module_profile.pot as the admin help page indicates.

    This Section API also includes an interface to load a section through AJAX.
    The URL of the function is /ajax.php?module=Profile&func=profilesection
    and needs the following parameters: $uid, $name and optionally an array of arguments ($args).

    Enjoy!
